# Outward_Weapon-Armor_Enchant_Expansion_Edit
This repo just holds edited XML files for the Outward Definitive Edition Mods Weapon Enchant Expansion and Armor Enchant Expansion by craigerade. These need to replace the corresponding files created by these mods.
These files aim to remove as many of the limitations of the enchantment system as possible. This is done by letting any weapon have almost any weapon enchantment and letting any armor piece have almost any armor.
Currently, Caldera enchantments for weapons are not changed, as multiple recipes are the same and have no way of differentiating between which enchantment to give an item in this situation. The same problem is found
for Light as Wind, Guidance of Wind, and Primal Wind.

Installation instructions:
1. Open Users\*username*\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\OutwardDe\profiles\Default\BepInEx\plugins
2. Open craigerade-Armor_Enchant_Expansion\SideLoader\Enchantments
3. Copy/Paste the armor enchantment files into this folder
4. Repeat with the weapon enchantment files in craigerade-Weapon_Enchant_Expansion\Sideloader\Enchantments
